# ML-Model-training
Training a model using a labeled dataset of 8500 images 

Integration of a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and live camera input, the system is capable of classifying waste items into multiple predefined categories like cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic and trash.

CNNs are highly effective in image-based recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies and features from visual data.

The model used here has been trained and fine-tuned on a Kaggle dataset comprising of various types of wastes, such as plastic, metal, glass, cardboard, ensuring high classification accuracy of 85%

Technology stack:

  Framework: Pytorch

• An open-source machine learning framework that provides dynamic computation graphs, making it easier to debug and experiment with models.

  Models: CNN
• CNNs are specifically designed for image recognition tasks.

• They use convolutional layers to automatically extract relevant visual features like edges, textures, shapes, and patterns.

Programming language: Python
